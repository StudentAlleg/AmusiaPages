    <h1>Amusia</h1>
    <p>Amusia is a 2D Metroidvania game about Lambert, who stumbles into a fantasy world of
        classical music. His goal is to destroy this world by finding its cores and destroying them.
        Venture in this world as you explore musically inspired areas and landscapes while defending
        yourself against wild life and the world’s inhabitants.
        This game has fast paced and challenging combat inspired by Sekiro. Explore the world using
        fluid and momentous movement inspired by Celeste. Experience satisfying geographical and
        gameplay progression inspired by Hollow Knight. And most importantly, uncover Lambert’s
        story.</p>

    <div>
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <p>This is a vertical slice made for CMPM-171 at UCSC. We had to operate under the following constraints:</p>
    
    <div class = "constraint">
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            Game must be Completable by the people with the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Limited Vision (Seeing)</li>
                <li>Limited Dexterity (Touching)</li>
                <li>Limited Audition (Hearing)</li>
                <li>Limited Energy and Attention (Resting)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Amusia allows control rebinding, which allows for players to play with any device they prefer. Amusia is scaled so that one-handed players could beat it. Colors are not important to gameplay, in grayscale, all required features are distinct enough to work. Sound is used as an added benefit to gameplay designed, but is not required to complete the game.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "constraint">
        <h3>Localization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your game must support players two use two different written languages. At least one language must use either a logographic script or a right-to-left script.</li>
            <li>The ability to localize them game to additional written languages should be supported by your localization kit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On loading the game, there is a language select screen. In this screen, you can choose between US English and Simplified Chinese. This can also be accessed through settings. In our Unity project, we have localization tables, which can be used to add more languages to the game in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "constraint">
        <h3>Game Format</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The game must be entirely completable while the player's device is disconnected from the internet.</li>
            <li>The total data transfer involved in downloading the game must be less than 100 MiB Links to an external site..</li>
            <li>The game may target the platform of the team's choice (e.g. desktop, mobile, console, browser, etc.). However, if Windows is supported macOS must also be supported (at least in principle). If iOS is supported, Android must be supported too (at least in principle).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Amusia is a desktop based game, primarily developed for Windows. In order to also target for Mac, it would be relatively simple to change the build target to that platform. Amusia requires no internet connection, and has a download size of <b>INPUT DOWNLOAD SIZE HERE</b></p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <h3>Pre CMPM 171</h3>
        <p>Amusia had a movement system handled by a state machine. We also had a basic combat system and a broken boss fight. We also have environmental art for multiple levels. We also did a pause system and a very basic save system. We had health UI for the player and enemy, as well as a game over state</p>
